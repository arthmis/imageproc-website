                <h2>What is Image Processing?</h2>
                <p>
                    Image processing is a field in software development that is concerned with the manipulation
                    of images. At it's most basic, it's about using different algorithms to extract specific 
                    information about images or manipulate them into more desirable forms.
                    
                </p>
                <h2>What is an image to a computer?</h2>
                <p>
                    Digital images are represented as a matrix. They are a <i>n x m</i> grid of pixels
                    that are usually represented within the RGB color space. Each unit of an image is known as a pixel and each
                    pixel consists of a red, green, and blue value. Most viewing devices are built to display pixels of an image
                    therefore, within each pixel of the screen, there are 3 separate subpixels that emit light for each primary color. Internally,
                    for example in a computer's memory, most image pixels are represented using 8 bits. Each color channel
                    is represented by 8 bits, making an image pixel in RGB color space 24 bits in total size. 
                </p>
                <h2>Why is image processing relevant?</h2>
                <p>
                    Image processing is involved in some shape or form whenever digital images are being handled. Before
                    images are displayed on any screen or device, the image is manipulated by the monitor or the gpu.
                    When a camera takes an image, it does its own processing on the image for final viewing by the user. 
                    Autonomous vehicles capture the environment around them, and gather information on their environment
                    using different image processing techniques in order to get the information it needs to make decisions. Image editors have the strongest
                    relation to image processing as a field. Image editors combine image processing algorithms into
                    powerful editing operations that achieve effects that are useful for transforming photos or videos to suit an artist's 
                    creative vision. In deep space photography, astronomers use the properties of the light spectrum to capture the vivid colors of deep space
                    objects that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.

                    This website aims to demonstrate some basic image processing algorithms. It will show how they manipulate
                    images and explain what they are and how they're used in different imaging contexts.
