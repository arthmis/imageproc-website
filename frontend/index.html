        <h1>Image Processing</h1>
        <h2>What is Image Processing?</h2>
        <p>
            Image processing consists of algorithms that are used to manipulate images. They are
            either used to preprocess an image for further processing or to create interesting effects
            and image manipulations. 
        </p>
        <h2>What is an Image?</h2>
        <p>
            Images in the digital world are essentially represented as a matrix. They are a n x m grid of pixels
            that are usually represented with the RGB color space. Each unit of an image is known as a pixel and each
            pixel consists of a red, green, and blue value. Most viewing devices are built the same way and within
            each pixel of the screen, there are 3 separate subpixels that emit light for each primary color. Internally,
            for example in a computer's memory, most image pixels are represented using 8 bits. Pixels represented with larger
            amounts of bits are larger, but have smoother gradients. They can handle more image processing
            before the information in the image is visually damaged.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is image processing relevant?</h2>
        <p>
            Image processing is used in some shape or form whenever digital images are being handled. Before
            images are displayed on any screen or device, the image is manipulated by the monitor or the gpu.
            When a camera takes an image, it does its own processing on the image for final viewing by the user. 
            Autonomous vehicles capture the environment around them, and gather information on their environment
            using different image processing techniques in order to make decisions. Image editors have the strongest
            relation to image processing as a field, because image editors distill image process algorithms into
            focused operations that achieve effects that are useful for a someone's creative vision. In deep space
            photography, astronomers use the properties of the light spectrum to capture the vivid colors of deep space
            objects that require multiple exposures in different light spectrums in order to catpure.

        <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
        <p>
            This website aims to demonstrate some basic image processing algorithms and show how they manipulate
            images and explain what they are and how they're used in different imaging contexts.
        </p>
        <h2>Imaging pipeline</h2>
        <p>
            Cameras are usually the primary imaging device. Cameras have sensors that particularly sensitive
            to light. They in fact capture most light from the entire light spectrum like infrared and ultraviolet.
            Cameras take photos and videos; from there, it converts the analog signal, or the photons that hit
            the sensor into a digital signal. The more light that hits the sensor, the better the analog signal, the less
            noise is found in the image. The image or video that is converted from the analog signal is usually known as a
            raw image or video. This is the image in its purest form but it isn't appropriate for viewing and consumption
            like other image formats. There are certain programs that are capable of reading raw image formats. They are
            usually image editors. Raw image formats give an image the most amount of range for editing. Raw images
            have the most amount of information about an image, which allows more extreme editing while still preserving
            details and image dynamic range. For this explanation, however, I'll assume the camera edits the image
            for consumption and outputs a JPEG file. In order to do that, the camera throws away a lot of visually redundant
            information and compresses the image. It applies some modifications to the image's exposure and contrast, and
            creates a final image for viewing. From here, the user is free to do more image manipulation on the image, or send
            it for further processing on an image processing pipeline.
