                <p>
                    This website aims to demonstrate some basic image processing algorithms. It will show how they manipulate
                    images, explain what they are and how they're used in different imaging applications. You can click
                    the algorithms link or <a href="main.html">here</a> to go to the algorithms page. Otherwise continue reading
                    to get an overview of image processing.

                <p>
                    Image processing is a field in software development that is concerned with the manipulation
                    of images. At it's most basic, it's about using different algorithms to extract 
                    information about images or modify them into more useful forms.

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing">Image processing</a> is involved in some shape or form whenever digital images are being handled. Before
                    images are displayed on any screen or device, the image is manipulated by the monitor or the gpu.
                    When a camera takes an image, it does its own processing on the image for final viewing by the user. 
                    Image editing is closely related to image processing; sometimes they are used intechangeably depending on the context.
                    Image editors use image processing algorithms to modify images to make the more image more pleasing
                    or becomes someone's creative vision.

                    Feature extraction is an important application of image processing. It can be used to find corners in an
                    image, find different features of a face using only the difference in luminance between different
                    parts of a face. Object features detection are usually used in object detection machine learning
                    algorithms for different kinds of image classification.
                    A popular use of feature detection in computer vision are happens in face detection.
                    Haar like features are used in face detection applications using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework">viola-jones object detection
                    framework</a>. The algorithm goes through the image uses haar like features to train a learning
                    algorithm.

                    Examples of simple processing algorithms used in image editing are exposure compensation, contrast, and
                    color saturation adjustments.

                    Although primarily used in video, there are is an image processing data structures
                    called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPMRg6QSKmU">waveform</a>. This is similar to an image
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_histogram">histogram</a> but provides more information, however
                    is more computationally expensive to create.

                    Autonomous vehicles need capture the environment around them, and gather information
                    using different image processing techniques in order to make decisions in real time.
                    Autonomous vehicles must extract a myriad of information as it moves through its environment. One important
                    data point it has to acquire is where the lane boundaries are. If it were on a multilane highway,
                    it might do this by finding lines on the roads in front of the camera facing the incoming road. 
                    Here is a video of someone's attempt at lane detection:

                    There are a plethora of other applications using image processing to make the most out of
